            <p class="espaco">The date was initially called Armistice Day to commemorate the end of World War I. It was officially granted in 1926 through a resolution of the U.S. Congress. The date became a national holiday 12 years later by a similar action, by the U.S. Congress.<br>
                    If World War I had been "the war to end all wars," as it was called, November 11 could still be called Armistice Day. <br>
                    However, World War II would prove otherwise. The U.S. government, realizing that peace was equally preserved after the end of the conflict between the participating nations, Congress decided to create an occasion to honor all those who served the United States (USA). <br>
                    In 1954, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed a law project proclaiming November 11 as Veterans Day. Since then, the date would come to recognize the veterans of all wars and then all who served in the U.S. Armed Forces. </p>

                “To us in America, the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country’s service and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the councils of the nations …” <br>
                
                The original concept for the celebration was a day observed with parades and public meetings and a brief suspension of business from 11am.

            <p class="espaco">A Law (52 Stat. 351; 5 US Code, Sec. 87a) passed on May 13, 1938, made November 11 of each year a legal holiday - a day to be dedicated to the cause of world peace and to be celebrated later and known as "Armistice Day." Armistice Day was primarily a day reserved to honor World War I veterans, but in 1954, after World War II, it required the largest mobilization of soldiers, sailors, Marines, and airmen in the nation's history; After U.S. forces fought aggression in Korea, the 83rd Congress, at the request of veterans service organizations, amended the 1938 Act by eliminating the word "Armistice" and inserting the word "Veterans". With the passage of this legislation (Public Law 380) on June 1, 1954, November 11 became a day to honor American veterans of all wars.

                Later that year, on October 8, President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued the first "Veterans Day Proclamation" that declared, "To ensure proper and broad observance of this anniversary, all veterans, all veterans organizations, and all citizens will want to hold hands on a common purpose. To this end, I am designating the Veterans Affairs Administrator as Chairman of a National Veterans Day Committee, which will include others that the President can select and who will coordinate at the national level the necessary planning for compliance. I am also asking the heads of all departments and agencies of the Executive Branch of the Government to assist the National Committee in every possible way."
